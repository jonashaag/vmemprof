# vmemprof

Usage: vmemprof.py <vmprof.dat>

Where vmprof.dat is a profile file generated by vmprof with memory
profiling (like this: vmprof.enable(fileno, 0.01, True))

It visualizes total RSS of your program vs time and shows tracebacks
for each point. The example flask server will resample the data.

The basic interactive feature is zoom in, which can be done by clicking
on two points on the graph. Tracebacks will have all the python functions
on the stack (but not say Cython, pending future improvements to vmprof).
